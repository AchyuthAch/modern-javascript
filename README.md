**Modern Javascript**

JS Basics

JavaScript Data Types are like below<br>

**String Methods/Properties:**<br>
Concatenation, indexOf(), .length , .toUpperCase(), .toLowerCase(), lastIndexOf(), replace(), slice(), substring()

**Numbers Methods/Properties**<br>
Flow of calculation would follow BIDMAS at JS
Number cancatenation with template strings would follow like `${}`

**Arrays**<br>
Arrays are a collection of data which are stored in a memory and can be seen in coding as [ ]<br>
We can store the multiple data types in an array and access it anywhere at the code<br>
*Methods & Properties in Arrays* <br>
length--> To cal length of an array<br>
.join("-") --> Joins the array elements with - added into the elements which are placed at code<br>
Push("add") --> Appends the new element to existing array(Comes under destruction of arrays)<br>
Pop("remove") --> Deletes the existing elements to existing array(Comes under destruction of arrays)<br>
IndexOf() --> Tracks the index of an element<br>
concat(["new1", "new2"]) --> Add new elements to existing array<br>

**Null & Undefined**<br>
Null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value <br>
Undefined is a value that represents the intentional & unintentional absence of any object value.

**Booleans**
True or False would be the elements which comes as Booleans<br>
.includes("checkif") ==> Checks whether an elements are present at the Array<br>
//Comparison Operators<br>
== , !=, < , >, <=, <= <br>
These operators can be used to compare numbers, strings and often called as loose operators as it doesnt checks the type<br>
Strict operators comes as ===, !==, <==, >== and checks the type<br>

*Type Conversions*<br>
For any string to number conversions we use Number() to convert<br>
To check the specific type of any data types we use typeof(variable)<br>
*Boolean Conversions*<br>
Any Boolean(0) will be false<br>
Any Boolean('') will be false<br>
Any Boolean("string") will be true<br>
